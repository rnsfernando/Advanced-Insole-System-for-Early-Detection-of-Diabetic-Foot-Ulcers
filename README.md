# Advanced-Insole-System-for-Early-Detection-of-Diabetic-Foot-Ulcers
The project aims to develop an advanced insole system for the early detection of diabetic foot ulcers. This repository includes only the basic prototype, which measures pressure and temperature distributions with data transmitted to a cloud-based platform for visualization.

## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced insole system integrated with pressure and temperature sensors, non-invasive transcutaneous oxygen diffusion monitoring, vibratory sensory technology, and deep learning-based decision fusion and thermal image processing techniques. The primary goal is to enhance early detection of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) and improve patient outcomes through timely intervention.

## Features
### Pressure and Temperature Sensors:
- FSR 402 Pressure Sensor
- DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Temperature Sensor
- Monitors distribution across the foot to identify potential risk areas.

### Transcutaneous Oxygen Tension (TcPO2) Monitoring:
- Non-invasive sensor to measure oxygen diffusion.
- Identifies damaged tissues to guide clinical interventions.

### Vibratory Sensory Technology:
- Assesses nerve functionality by stimulating critical sensory points.
- Monitors neural sensitivity using accelerometers, piezoelectric sensors, or contactless capacitive sensors.

### Deep Learning and Thermal Imaging:
- Utilizes pre-trained CNN architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNetV2.
- Decision fusion rules enhance classification performance of thermal images.
- Early detection of DFUs reduces amputation rates and healthcare costs.

## Implementation
### Initial Concept
- Enhance current assessment processes using sensors and microcontroller-based devices.
- Employ deep learning for early detection of DFU using decision fusion and thermal images.
- Use electromyography for early DFU detection.

### Final Concept
Develop an insole system integrating:
- Pressure and temperature sensors for mapping foot distribution.
- Non-invasive TcPO2 monitoring for measuring oxygen diffusion.
- Vibratory sensory technology to assess nerve functionality.
- Deep learning-based decision fusion and thermal image processing for accurate DFU detection.

## Prototyping
### First Bench Model Prototype:
- Insole measures pressure and temperature distributions.
- Data transmitted to a cloud-based platform for advanced visualization.

### Second Tissue Testing Model Prototype:
- Adds non-invasive TcPO2 monitoring for enhanced accuracy.

### Final Implementation:
- Incorporates vibratory sensory technology and deep learning for comprehensive DFU risk assessment.
